00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.440 align:center line:-5
Uncle Dinesh, juice?
- Yes.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.480 align:center line:-5
Divya, the food has been served.
Go and call everyone.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.640 align:center line:-1
Okay.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.040 align:center line:-5
Come on, everyone.
The food is ready.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.200 align:center line:-1
Abhi, come on!

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.160 align:center line:-1
Mom, dad and Veeru! Come here!

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.600 align:center line:-1
Oh! Who kept the sweets here?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.840 align:center line:-1
Divya.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.640 align:center line:-1
My dear, what is this?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.640 align:center line:-5
You have been distributing sweets
to everyone and didn't offer me!

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.760 align:center line:-1
May I ask you why?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.240 align:center line:-5
Because the doctor has advised you
against eating sweets.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.000 align:center line:-5
I was also advised against
marrying you.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.040 align:center line:-1
But I married you, right?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.320 align:center line:-2
Okay, fine. I won't eat any sweets
if you say so.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.960 align:center line:-1
Go on, uncle.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.800 align:center line:-2
You can eat as many sweets
as you want.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.960 align:center line:-2
Here's my champ!
- Raghav!

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.640 align:center line:-2
Aunt, a suitor and his family
will be here to meet Unni tomorrow.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.160 align:center line:-1
It's a happy occasion. Let him eat.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.760 align:center line:-2
Okay. I will allow you to eat
one piece for Raghav's sake.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.560 align:center line:-1
You never turn Raghav down.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.120 align:center line:-1
Do you want to eat these sweets?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.480 align:center line:-1
Of course, I want to.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.200 align:center line:-2
Thank you.
- If you are done with this,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.520 align:center line:-1
can we all have the food?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.120 align:center line:-2
My son must be hungry.
- Yes.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.640 align:center line:-2
Am I right?
- I am hungry.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.040 align:center line:-2
Let's go.
- I'll pray to the Goddess

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840 align:center line:-2
that everything happens
smoothly tomorrow.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.400 align:center line:-2
Veeru.
- Yes.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.160 align:center line:-1
What about the flowers?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.680 align:center line:-2
I have spoken to the vendor.
They'll be here soon.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.520 align:center line:-2
Pratik.
- Yes, Raghav.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.840 align:center line:-2
I have heard you want to start
a new business again.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.320 align:center line:-2
Tell me what information
you have collected.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.120 align:center line:-1
Raghav, the proposal is ready.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.080 align:center line:-1
I will show it to you.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.240 align:center line:-2
But you should look at her for now.
Your sister looks like a princess.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.600 align:center line:-1
Ta-da!

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.200 align:center line:-1
Why did you grow up so early?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.360 align:center line:-2
Why don't you drop the idea
of getting me married?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.280 align:center line:-1
I will live with you forever.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120 align:center line:-2
If it were in my hands, I would
never let you go anywhere.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800 align:center line:-2
Raghav, you are already
getting emotional.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.760 align:center line:-2
By the way, you didn't say
anything about Unnati's look.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.480 align:center line:-1
Show me your hands.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.280 align:center line:-2
You apply red nail paint when
you have to attend a party, right?

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.800 align:center line:-1
Caught her!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.600 align:center line:-1
What do you mean?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.520 align:center line:-1
I was talking about the bird.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.440 align:center line:-2
I have been playing
a game since the morning.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.000 align:center line:-2
I couldn't catch this bird.
But I finally did.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.400 align:center line:-1
Unnati.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.200 align:center line:-1
Come here.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.680 align:center line:-2
Listen, a suitor will be here
to meet you tomorrow.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.000 align:center line:-2
Don't do anything in the present
that affects your future.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.560 align:center line:-2
Okay, aunt.
- Come on. Let's have the food.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.000 align:center line:-2
You may carry on.
I'll change and be back.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.040 align:center line:-2
I am such an idiot! No going
to the farewell party now!

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.200 align:center line:-1
Who ate my 'ras malai'?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.360 align:center line:-1
Look, nothing is left for me.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.600 align:center line:-1
No one ate it, Suman.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.240 align:center line:-1
Yes. You ate it.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.120 align:center line:-1
When did I eat it?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.760 align:center line:-1
You ate it in front of me.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.200 align:center line:-2
Look, you also have the bowl
in your hands.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.280 align:center line:-1
Did I eat all of it?

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.640 align:center line:-2
Oh! To hell with
this forgetful nature!

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.640 align:center line:-1
I ate Reet's 'ras malai', too.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.720 align:center line:-1
What will she eat now?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.600 align:center line:-2
Come here.
- Mom!

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.680 align:center line:-2
You expose others
in front of the world.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.600 align:center line:-2
And you make your mom
and brother lie at home!

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.360 align:center line:-1
Mom, one more on my behalf.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.480 align:center line:-1
Do you want a slap?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.160 align:center line:-1
Sorry.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.600 align:center line:-2
And you...
- Sorry, mom!

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.160 align:center line:-1
'Sorry!'

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.600 align:center line:-2
I have so much work to do,
but they want to have fun.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.160 align:center line:-1
Why are you grinning?

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.800 align:center line:-1
Go and get ready. Come on.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.120 align:center line:-2
Get ready for the party.
- Yes, I am going.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.920 align:center line:-2
Cheers!
- What's up? How are you?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.200 align:center line:-2
Dhruv!
- All good?

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.040 align:center line:-2
How are you?
- I am great!

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.400 align:center line:-2
Did you get admission
to SR MBA College?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.360 align:center line:-1
Yes.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.200 align:center line:-1
Someone cancelled his admission.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.360 align:center line:-2
So, I got the admission.
- Wow!

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.480 align:center line:-1
I am going to Delhi tomorrow.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.680 align:center line:-2
That's great!
- Let's have three cheers for Dhruv!

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.840 align:center line:-2
Hip, hip...
- Hurray!

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.880 align:center line:-2
Hip, hip...
- Hurray!

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.920 align:center line:-2
I didn't think this boring Dhruv
would get into a happening college.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.200 align:center line:-1
We didn't think of this either.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.760 align:center line:-2
Hi, girls!
- Hi!

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.480 align:center line:-2
How do I look?
- Like always, wow!

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.000 align:center line:-2
How did you get your brother's
permission to attend the party?

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.840 align:center line:-1
My brother surprises me sometimes.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.720 align:center line:-2
This is the second biggest
surprise for tonight.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.400 align:center line:-2
Which was the first one?
- Dhruv.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.080 align:center line:-1
Dhruv? What happened to him?

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.520 align:center line:-2
Dhruv Chaudhary got admission
to SR College.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.600 align:center line:-1
SR College, Delhi!

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.800 align:center line:-1
He is leaving tomorrow.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.560 align:center line:-1
Let me get a soft drink.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.440 align:center line:-1
Unnati is so lucky.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.160 align:center line:-2
She already had her brother's
immense love and wealth.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.040 align:center line:-2
Now, she is also getting married
to the richest family in Gwalior.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.560 align:center line:-1
Please take a sip.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.040 align:center line:-2
One sip won't harm you.
- Come on.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.680 align:center line:-1
You know that I don't drink, right?

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.280 align:center line:-2
Oh, God!
- Hey, guys!

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.880 align:center line:-2
Why are you troubling
this good boy?

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.520 align:center line:-1
You can have orange juice, right?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000 align:center line:-1
Sure.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.840 align:center line:-2
Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.440 align:center line:-1
What is this?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.840 align:center line:-1
Answer me, Reet. What is this?

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.680 align:center line:-2
Mom, I...
- You were granted admission

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.120 align:center line:-2
to a prestigious college in Mumbai
for your journalism course.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.480 align:center line:-1
And you didn't even tell me!

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.480 align:center line:-1
You threw their letter away!

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.760 align:center line:-1
A degree, fame, money...

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.720 align:center line:-1
Do you want all this only for Dhruv?

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.320 align:center line:-2
Do you want to work
only as a small-time reporter?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880 align:center line:-1
Why, Reet?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.680 align:center line:-1
Because you live in Gwalior.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.200 align:center line:-1
I have a job here.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.520 align:center line:-1
Yes, I am on probation for now.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.520 align:center line:-2
But my job will be confirmed
after four months.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.080 align:center line:-2
And Dhruv is about to fulfil
one of my dreams, right?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.840 align:center line:-2
You don't have to worry about
my dream. It will be fulfilled.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.520 align:center line:-2
I can fulfil my dream by staying
in Gwalior instead of Mumbai.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.000 align:center line:-1
After your dad's demise,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.160 align:center line:-2
you gave up all your dreams
to take care of this family.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.760 align:center line:-1
And we didn't realise

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.400 align:center line:-1
when we started burdening you

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.640 align:center line:-1
for fulfilling our wishes.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.960 align:center line:-1
Your daughter wants to become

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.760 align:center line:-1
a leading investigative reporter.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.320 align:center line:-1
And I will become one.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.720 align:center line:-1
Dad was forced to remain silent

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.040 align:center line:-1
because he was poor and helpless.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.200 align:center line:-1
He couldn't speak the truth.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.200 align:center line:-1
But your daughter

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.200 align:center line:-1
will reveal that truth to the world.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.480 align:center line:-1
Right?

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.720 align:center line:-1
"I chase you all the time."

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.120 align:center line:-1
"I am crazy about you."

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.680 align:center line:-2
"Where I confessed
my feelings to you..."

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.600 align:center line:-2
"Where I confessed
my feelings to you,"

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.440 align:center line:-1
"you broke up with me."

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.360 align:center line:-1
"Didn't you feel bad for me?"

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.520 align:center line:-2
"You summoned me at the same place
to break my heart."

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.360 align:center line:-1
Dhruv!

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.200 align:center line:-1
Unnati, I am so sorry.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.720 align:center line:-2
Why do you drink
if you can't handle yourself?

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.960 align:center line:-1
You ruined my dress!

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.400 align:center line:-1
Hold this!

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.840 align:center line:-2
Unnati... Unnati, listen.
I am sorry.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.800 align:center line:-1
He spoiled my dress!

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.320 align:center line:-1
Unnati! Unnati!

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.440 align:center line:-1
What the hell, Dhruv!

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.160 align:center line:-1
Unnati!

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.240 align:center line:-1
'Miss Richie Rich will have'

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.720 align:center line:-1
'a spectacle in her life tomorrow.'

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.600 align:center line:-1
Unnati!

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.040 align:center line:-1
What is this?

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.880 align:center line:-1
What is all this? Answer me!

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.920 align:center line:-2
Did you secretly go
to a party last night?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.480 align:center line:-2
The video of what happened between
you and that boy at the party

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.280 align:center line:-1
has been circulated in the city.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.440 align:center line:-1
Look at this!

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.640 align:center line:-1
How dare you

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.240 align:center line:-2
bring disgrace to our family?
How could you ruin our reputation?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.560 align:center line:-1
It is rightly said.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.120 align:center line:-2
There is a black sheep
in every family.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.680 align:center line:-1
Aunt, please don't tell Raghav.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.120 align:center line:-1
I don't have to.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.800 align:center line:-2
The news of what you did last night
has spread like wildfire.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.880 align:center line:-2
Do you think Raghav won't
find out the truth?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.400 align:center line:-1
He just did.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.600 align:center line:-1
Are you okay?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.400 align:center line:-2
Raghav, what you saw
in the video wasn't true.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.640 align:center line:-1
He was a little drunk.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.880 align:center line:-2
I took care of myself.
I was safe, Raghav.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.280 align:center line:-1
Who was he?

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.720 align:center line:-1
Where can I find him?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.040 align:center line:-2
Come on! Hop on
if you want to go to Delhi!

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.880 align:center line:-2
Come quickly, Dhruv.
You can't miss the bus.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.360 align:center line:-1
Did you carry everything?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.120 align:center line:-2
Your clothes... Mom, did you
keep his clothes? - Yes.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.080 align:center line:-1
What about your books?

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.680 align:center line:-1
Don't tilt the jar of ghee.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.800 align:center line:-1
Or else your clothes will be spoilt.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.640 align:center line:-2
I hope you didn't miss anything.
- No, Reet.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.120 align:center line:-1
Except for your chattering.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.440 align:center line:-1
Will you survive without me?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.680 align:center line:-1
Yes. Of course.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.480 align:center line:-2
Once you are gone, I'll be
able to eat more 'ras malai'.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.200 align:center line:-1
Hop on for going to Delhi!

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.120 align:center line:-1
Take care of yourself.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.080 align:center line:-2
Bless you.
- Bye.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.520 align:center line:-2
Study hard.
- Yes.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.080 align:center line:-1
Go quickly now. You can't be late.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.800 align:center line:-2
Reet, he forgot the bag!
- Yes. Take the bag.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.000 align:center line:-1
Take your bag, Dhruv.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.280 align:center line:-2
Study well, Dhruv.
Don't eat outside food.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.520 align:center line:-1
Okay.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.080 align:center line:-1
Take care of yourself.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.200 align:center line:-1
Dhruv!

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.680 align:center line:-1
Dhruv!

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.520 align:center line:-1
Drive away!

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.040 align:center line:-1
This boy won't leave Gwalior now.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.560 align:center line:-1
How dare you touch my brother?

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.240 align:center line:-1
How dare he touch my sister?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.480 align:center line:-2
Stop! Dhruv, the bus is leaving!
Come on!

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.000 align:center line:-2
You must face the consequences
of your actions before you leave.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640 align:center line:-1
Dhruv!

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.360 align:center line:-2
Which girl? I don't know
who you are talking about.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.320 align:center line:-1
Dhruv!

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.040 align:center line:-1
No!

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.400 align:center line:-1
Dhruv!

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.080 align:center line:-1
Leave him!

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.000 align:center line:-1
How dare you touch my sister?

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.960 align:center line:-2
Mister... Mister, save my son!
I beg you!

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.760 align:center line:-1
Dhruv! No!

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.400 align:center line:-1
I beg you! Please don't hit him!

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.120 align:center line:-1
No! Please!

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.440 align:center line:-1
Please don't hit him!

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.840 align:center line:-1
Leave him! I said leave him!

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.440 align:center line:-2
Who are you?
And why are you hitting my brother?

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.960 align:center line:-1
He missed his bus because of you!

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.960 align:center line:-1
You have shattered our dream!

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.800 align:center line:-1
What has Dhruv done?

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.080 align:center line:-2
He has made the biggest mistake
of his life.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.400 align:center line:-1
Look at this!

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.800 align:center line:-1
Sister-in-law.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.760 align:center line:-2
I can't do her make-up
until she stops crying.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.880 align:center line:-1
Please try to understand, Divya.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.080 align:center line:-2
Poor Unnati must be in pain.
She must be scared.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.160 align:center line:-2
Why did she leave the house at night
and do all that then?

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.280 align:center line:-2
Raghav hasn't punished her
in his signature style yet.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.040 align:center line:-1
You are right, Divya.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.760 align:center line:-2
I should be punished
for what I have done.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.240 align:center line:-1
I am not worthy of this alliance.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.880 align:center line:-2
You have already
disgraced us publicly.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.600 align:center line:-2
What is this? The suitor
will be here at any moment.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.960 align:center line:-2
Why haven't you done
her make-up yet, Ms Morena?

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.480 align:center line:-1
Mother, I tried everything.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.760 align:center line:-2
But the make-up won't set
because she has been crying a lot.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.960 align:center line:-1
What do I do now?

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.080 align:center line:-2
You can only upload status
on your social media.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.480 align:center line:-1
'Doing make-up. Feeling happy.'

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.000 align:center line:-1
Poonam, bring some salt.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.040 align:center line:-2
Do you want to ward off
the evil eye over Unnati?

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.200 align:center line:-1
No.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.600 align:center line:-2
Maybe she wants to rub some salt
into our wounds.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.800 align:center line:-1
If you don't want to do that,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.720 align:center line:-1
become shameless like last night.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.920 align:center line:-1
Wipe your tears.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.880 align:center line:-1
Chin up and eyes down.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.640 align:center line:-2
Don't you dare share the details of
your shameless incident with anyone.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.400 align:center line:-2
Thank God the suitor's family
hasn't seen

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.840 align:center line:-1
your video yet.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.520 align:center line:-2
Otherwise, there would
have been a disaster.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.840 align:center line:-2
I thought our mother-in-law
could only set us straight.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.680 align:center line:-1
But she can do make-up as well.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.680 align:center line:-2
Hello. Is the suitor on his way?
Okay. I'll be there.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.240 align:center line:-2
Come on.
Let's make all the preparations.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.280 align:center line:-1
Let's go quickly.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.400 align:center line:-1
I won't spare his life.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.680 align:center line:-2
It's your aunt's call.
She is calling.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.000 align:center line:-2
Yes, aunt.
- Raghav.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.600 align:center line:-1
Come home right away.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.640 align:center line:-2
The suitor and his family
are on their way.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.040 align:center line:-1
Leave whatever you are doing.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.840 align:center line:-1
You need to be here right now.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.240 align:center line:-1
Come home.
