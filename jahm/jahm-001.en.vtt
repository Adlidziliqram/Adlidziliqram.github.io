00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.840 align:center line:-1
'Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.'

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.120 align:center line:-1
'Greetings, India!'

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.280 align:center line:-2
'Everyone says that in the end,
truth always prevails,'

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.560 align:center line:-1
but Reet says,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.560 align:center line:-5
'Yes, In the end,
truth always prevails.'

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.520 align:center line:-5
'But the path of truth
is fraught with difficulties'

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.760 align:center line:-5
'because today, the truth
isn't what's being shown.'

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.640 align:center line:-1
'The truth is also being hidden.'

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.760 align:center line:-5
'But as long as Reet is here,
truth will prevail.'

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.480 align:center line:-5
Though Gwalior is famous for silk
and its tall castles,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200 align:center line:-5
we are here to witness the fight
between two brothers for Shabri.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.280 align:center line:-5
The younger and poor brother,
Manichand, has accused

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.680 align:center line:-5
his older brother, Dhanichand,
of stealing his only Shabri.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.840 align:center line:-5
That's why I, Arvind Kesari,
your news reporter,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.000 align:center line:-5
have come here to find out
who Shabri belongs to.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.640 align:center line:-5
As usual, truth will prevail
once again.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.480 align:center line:-2
What is the truth?
Shabri will reveal the truth to us.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.040 align:center line:-2
What did you say? Will Shabri,
the buffalo, tell the truth?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.480 align:center line:-1
Though Shabri is a buffalo,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.400 align:center line:-2
it is said that even animals
understand

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.920 align:center line:-1
the language of love and care.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.720 align:center line:-1
Let's put it to the test today.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.280 align:center line:-2
We will make Shabri stand
between Dhanichand and Manichand.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.760 align:center line:-2
After that, both the brothers
will call out to Shabri with love.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.120 align:center line:-1
Let's see

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.440 align:center line:-2
whose language of love Shabri
understands and to whom she goes.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.680 align:center line:-2
The person Shabri chooses
will get Shabri.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.880 align:center line:-2
Ms Chaudhary, what are you doing?
We aren't even permanent employees.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.160 align:center line:-2
Let's just cover the story
like the others and leave.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.880 align:center line:-2
Be quiet and hold the camera.
Come on.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.600 align:center line:-2
Mr Manichand, go there
and call Shabri.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.240 align:center line:-1
Shabri.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.360 align:center line:-1
Shabri.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.120 align:center line:-2
Raghav Suryavanshi always walks
ahead of time.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.040 align:center line:-2
Even time doesn't have the courage
to walk before Raghav Suryavanshi.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.160 align:center line:-2
Don't worry. I'll be there
before time

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.600 align:center line:-2
to sign the deal papers
for the flyover construction.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.600 align:center line:-2
Unfortunately, Shabri, the buffalo,
could not understand

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.720 align:center line:-1
the language of love.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.760 align:center line:-1
Maybe some reporters might realise

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.800 align:center line:-2
that they can make the news sound
interesting by embellishing it,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.800 align:center line:-1
but they cannot change the truth.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.360 align:center line:-2
If I wanted to embellish things,
I would have sold accessories

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.120 align:center line:-1
instead of the truth.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.000 align:center line:-1
Do you remember that you told me

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.800 align:center line:-2
that you used to sing songs
for Shabri

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.560 align:center line:-2
whenever you took her out
for a walk?

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.520 align:center line:-1
Sing that song for her.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.960 align:center line:-1
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.960 align:center line:-1
Shabri gives 100 litres of milk.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.840 align:center line:-2
She gives me a signal
whenever she is hungry.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.000 align:center line:-1
After that, I feed her hay.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.720 align:center line:-1
Eenie meenie miney mo.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.680 align:center line:-1
Shabri gives 100 litres of milk.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.360 align:center line:-1
Eenie meenie miney mo.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.440 align:center line:-1
Shabri gives 100 litres of milk.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.640 align:center line:-2
Look, once again,
the language of love

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.200 align:center line:-2
overpowered the language
of money and power.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.040 align:center line:-2
People say that one should do
good deeds and forget about them,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.520 align:center line:-2
but Reet says
that if you are telling the truth...

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.360 align:center line:-2
What's going on? Move aside!
- All of you...

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.720 align:center line:-2
Make way.
- Look, no one will move.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.240 align:center line:-1
Please turn your cars around.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.760 align:center line:-1
You have to move.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.160 align:center line:-1
What drama is this?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.920 align:center line:-1
You think this is a drama!

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.320 align:center line:-2
We are fighting a battle
for the truth and justice.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.480 align:center line:-1
Why? Are the courts shut today?

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.280 align:center line:-2
Why are you serving justice
on the road?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.680 align:center line:-1
I am getting late.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.040 align:center line:-2
Bhomik, ask him how much
the buffalo is for.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.400 align:center line:-2
Pay him double the price
and get this place cleared.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.120 align:center line:-1
Hello, mister.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.880 align:center line:-1
Whoever you may be.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.240 align:center line:-2
You may be rich, but you can't
flaunt your wealth here.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.960 align:center line:-1
We are reporting an incident here.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.840 align:center line:-2
Your reporting is quite cheap
compared to my deal.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.560 align:center line:-2
What are you trying to say?
Our news is cheap!

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.680 align:center line:-1
Absolutely.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.040 align:center line:-2
That's why the newspapers that
are sold for Rs 15 in the morning

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.840 align:center line:-2
are sold for Rs 15 a kilo
in the evening as scrap.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.960 align:center line:-2
Look, mister. You can't compare
people to scrap

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.120 align:center line:-1
because not everyone can be bought.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.440 align:center line:-1
Bhomik!

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.880 align:center line:-1
Oh my!

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.280 align:center line:-1
Pick it up.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.840 align:center line:-2
Collect it.
- Pick it up.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.560 align:center line:-2
Look over there.
- Pick it up.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.480 align:center line:-1
Pick it up.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.240 align:center line:-1
Come on. Hurry up.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.240 align:center line:-2
Look over there.
- Pick it up.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.720 align:center line:-1
It's there. Here.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.280 align:center line:-1
Wait. Where are you all going?

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.040 align:center line:-2
I have to record your statements
as well. Please wait.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.760 align:center line:-1
I am so sorry, ma'am.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.920 align:center line:-1
Listen, crazy man.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.160 align:center line:-2
The 500-rupee notes that you threw
are stuck to your car.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.440 align:center line:-2
You can use them to clean
your car, your designer suit

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.080 align:center line:-2
and the filth regarding money
that you have in your mind.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.960 align:center line:-1
Viraj!

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.600 align:center line:-1
Take a look at my reward.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.280 align:center line:-1
Five litres of Shabri's fresh milk.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.640 align:center line:-2
Look, Reet. I am so sorry. I can't
let you ride my new motorbike

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.160 align:center line:-1
with a can of milk.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.160 align:center line:-2
Actually, my mom fought with my dad
to buy me a motorbike.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.520 align:center line:-2
If you drop milk on it,
my mom will kill me.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.560 align:center line:-2
Are you afraid of your mom?
- Bye, Reet.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.880 align:center line:-1
Viraj!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.600 align:center line:-2
Firstly, my news got ruined
because of that rich brat.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.040 align:center line:-1
And now, he ruined my mood.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.440 align:center line:-1
Reet Chaudhary.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.160 align:center line:-2
How long will you keep reporting
for this ordinary news channel

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.360 align:center line:-1
and waste your time?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.680 align:center line:-2
Listen to me
and join our news channel.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.200 align:center line:-2
You will get a permanent job
and a guaranteed promotion.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.720 align:center line:-2
I am not working for Shekhar out of
compulsion, but because of a need.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.880 align:center line:-1
And Mr Arvind, you are a reporter,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.640 align:center line:-1
you should cover the news.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.520 align:center line:-2
My mom gives me enough advice
at home.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.160 align:center line:-1
What about your dad?

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.280 align:center line:-2
Could you find out
the truth about him?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.080 align:center line:-2
'I am telling the truth'. Didn't he
die in jail while saying this?

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.760 align:center line:-1
Don't think you can change the world

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.560 align:center line:-2
by showing these villagers
the truth.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.160 align:center line:-1
Do you understand, Reet Chaudhary?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.280 align:center line:-1
'Dad!'

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.720 align:center line:-1
'Dad, open your eyes.'

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.920 align:center line:-1
'Sister...'

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.840 align:center line:-1
'Why isn't dad saying anything?'

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.760 align:center line:-1
Yes, Dhruv.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.960 align:center line:-1
Reet!

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.400 align:center line:-2
You know Delhi's SRMP College.
- Yes.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.360 align:center line:-2
I was on the waiting list,
but now, I am on the confirmed list.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.840 align:center line:-1
What? Really?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.680 align:center line:-1
Yes. Just come home soon.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.840 align:center line:-1
I'll be right there.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.040 align:center line:-1
Autorickshaw! DD Nagar!

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.960 align:center line:-1
Stop! Wait!

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.560 align:center line:-1
Stop!

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.400 align:center line:-2
So many flowers!
Is someone getting married?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.000 align:center line:-1
It's not for a wedding.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.680 align:center line:-2
The suitor's family will be coming
to see my boss' sister.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.560 align:center line:-2
They ordered these flowers
to decorate the house.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.840 align:center line:-1
Is your boss...

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.560 align:center line:-1
What are you saying, ma'am?

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.160 align:center line:-2
No, no. I mean, they are spending
so much now.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.160 align:center line:-2
What will they do
during the wedding?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.880 align:center line:-2
They will decorate the whole
of Gwalior during the wedding?

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.600 align:center line:-1
My boss loves his sister a lot.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.440 align:center line:-2
What have you done?
- I am sorry.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.200 align:center line:-2
You spilt all the milk.
- I am sorry.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.960 align:center line:-2
Sorry. - These flowers
were for the function.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.640 align:center line:-1
What will I tell my boss now?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.320 align:center line:-1
Stop it.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.240 align:center line:-2
The function?
- No. The truck.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.240 align:center line:-1
I live here.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.880 align:center line:-1
Stop it.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.600 align:center line:-1
Thank you, and I am sorry.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.560 align:center line:-2
I think he loves his sister
as much as I love my brother Dhruv.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.120 align:center line:-1
Goddess,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.400 align:center line:-2
please grant the owner of the truck
Your blessings.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.560 align:center line:-2
Raghav, the cement work was left
because you came late.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.440 align:center line:-2
Please get it done.
We will handle the flowers.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.160 align:center line:-1
Stop.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.880 align:center line:-2
Why do Unnati's favourite flowers
have a smell?

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.560 align:center line:-1
Sir!

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.320 align:center line:-1
Sir, please forgive me.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.320 align:center line:-2
It wasn't my fault. I don't know
where that girl came from.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.480 align:center line:-2
She spilt milk on the flowers
and ran away.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.560 align:center line:-1
It wasn't my fault, sir.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.720 align:center line:-1
Sir...

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.680 align:center line:-1
Veeru, let him go.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.000 align:center line:-2
He admitted his mistake.
That's enough..

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.120 align:center line:-1
Give these flowers to the needy

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.880 align:center line:-2
and order a truckload of flowers
for my Unni again.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.040 align:center line:-1
Okay, sir.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.040 align:center line:-1
I want to decorate Unnati's life.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.440 align:center line:-1
I don't want any stains.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.120 align:center line:-1
And listen!

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.200 align:center line:-2
Put a board behind the truck
this time.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.560 align:center line:-2
Foolish girls are not allowed
near the truck.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.000 align:center line:-1
Okay, sir.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.400 align:center line:-1
'Mother's blessings'

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.120 align:center line:-1
'Mom!'

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.520 align:center line:-1
'Mom, where are you going?'

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.000 align:center line:-1
'Mom! Don't leave me, mom!'

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.240 align:center line:-1
'Mom, wait.'

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.960 align:center line:-1
'Mom!'

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.120 align:center line:-1
'Don't leave me!'

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.360 align:center line:-1
'Mom!'

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.120 align:center line:-1
'Don't leave me.'

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.800 align:center line:-1
'Mother's blessings'

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.600 align:center line:-1
'Mom, where are you going?'

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.680 align:center line:-1
'Mom!'

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.680 align:center line:-2
Raghav!
- Raghav!

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.000 align:center line:-1
'Mom, don't leave me!'

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.480 align:center line:-1
'Mom! Don't leave me.'

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.160 align:center line:-1
Raghav won't listen.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.960 align:center line:-1
Only one person can stop him now.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.320 align:center line:-1
Mother!

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.840 align:center line:-1
Raghav!

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.240 align:center line:-1
Leave it.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.200 align:center line:-1
What were you doing?

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.960 align:center line:-1
Raghav...

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.120 align:center line:-1
Reet...

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.400 align:center line:-2
You are too heavy.
- You need to know.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.640 align:center line:-1
Dhruv, you brat!

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.360 align:center line:-2
You have to shoulder the burden
of my happiness today.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.240 align:center line:-1
Fine. Break my bones.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.480 align:center line:-2
I won't be able to go to Delhi
because of this.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.120 align:center line:-2
You said it today.
Don't say it again.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.400 align:center line:-1
Okay, Reet.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.120 align:center line:-2
Come on.
- Where?

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.160 align:center line:-1
Come on.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.960 align:center line:-1
Join your hands.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.440 align:center line:-2
Goddess, thank You
for helping Dhruv get admission

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.280 align:center line:-1
to SR College.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.880 align:center line:-1
Look,

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.040 align:center line:-2
you've heard of the blue moon,
right? - Yes.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.920 align:center line:-2
You are my moon. That's why
you have to shine bright.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.800 align:center line:-2
I will shine brightly, Reet.
Just wait and watch.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.960 align:center line:-2
I'll go to Delhi, complete my MBA
and become a renowned businessman.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.520 align:center line:-1
I will make you proud.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.600 align:center line:-2
Oh my!
- Please do it, dear.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.840 align:center line:-2
But first, complete the tasks
that are still pending.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.480 align:center line:-2
He has to leave in the morning.
We have to make preparations.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.480 align:center line:-1
You started cooking stories, uncle.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.240 align:center line:-1
I love cooking.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.280 align:center line:-2
Why don't you make your special
'Lasooni Aloo' for us?

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.520 align:center line:-1
Absolutely.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.160 align:center line:-2
I'll go to Mr Gupta's shop and buy
'poha' and 'jalebi' for breakfast.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.560 align:center line:-2
Not Mr Gupta, aunt.
He is a doctor.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.000 align:center line:-2
Who sells 'Jalebi'?
- Mr Bansal.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.760 align:center line:-1
Isn't Bansal the laundry guy?

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.600 align:center line:-2
I am going to buy the ingredients
for 'aloo kachori'.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.080 align:center line:-1
Okay. Come on. Let's start packing.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.440 align:center line:-1
Why am I so forgetful?

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.560 align:center line:-1
Smita.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.080 align:center line:-1
Help me pack Dhruv's things,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.040 align:center line:-2
or he will walk like a primitive man
along with the cool crowd.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.840 align:center line:-2
Fine. I'll do it,
but what will I get in return?

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.400 align:center line:-1
Take this. A shiny cover.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.800 align:center line:-1
Fine, but this won't be enough.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.160 align:center line:-2
I want something big and expensive
next time.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.800 align:center line:-1
Okay, fine. Start packing.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.680 align:center line:-2
The cover is amazing.
You know my likes.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.320 align:center line:-1
Dhruv.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.360 align:center line:-1
Reet.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.760 align:center line:-1
What are you thinking, mom?

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.240 align:center line:-2
So much expense...
- Mom.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.360 align:center line:-1
I saved up for this day.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.000 align:center line:-1
Don't worry.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.920 align:center line:-1
How could I not worry?

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.600 align:center line:-1
Your uncle sells insurance policies.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.160 align:center line:-2
Thanks to the commission he earns,
we have some money at home,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.200 align:center line:-2
but we depend on your salary
and savings

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.680 align:center line:-1
for most of the expenses.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.480 align:center line:-2
People will say that I spend my
daughter's money on my son.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.880 align:center line:-2
Who cares about them? They even
ask if the guavas are sweet

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.480 align:center line:-1
before buying them.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.200 align:center line:-2
Yet they add salt and chilli powder
to the guava before eating it.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.920 align:center line:-1
You don't understand, Reet.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.400 align:center line:-2
Dad, really. You married a woman
who loves to complain.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.280 align:center line:-1
Reet!

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.520 align:center line:-1
There's 'rasmalai' at home.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.320 align:center line:-1
How did you know?

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.440 align:center line:-2
Your daughter is an investigative
reporter.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.920 align:center line:-1
She can unearth secrets.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.280 align:center line:-1
Yes.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.400 align:center line:-1
Mom, did you save some for me?

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.800 align:center line:-2
Yes, Ms Reporter.
I kept some for you.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.080 align:center line:-1
But there are only two.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.720 align:center line:-2
The other two are for your aunt.
Don't eat them.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.800 align:center line:-1
But...

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.080 align:center line:-2
Dhruv.
- Yes, Reet.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.960 align:center line:-2
College Farewell Party.
What will you wear?

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.160 align:center line:-2
I don't want to attend
the farewell party.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.640 align:center line:-1
Why not?

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.560 align:center line:-2
Who knows when you'll get to meet
your old friends? Go on.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.200 align:center line:-2
I don't know when I'll get the
chance to listen to your nonsense.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.640 align:center line:-1
Then?

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.080 align:center line:-1
I left the thermos. I'll bring it.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.240 align:center line:-1
You should have told me. I...

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.120 align:center line:-1
Reet!

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.480 align:center line:-1
Mom, the thermos is here.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.120 align:center line:-1
Reet went out to cry.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.680 align:center line:-1
It's been so long.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.480 align:center line:-1
Forget about it, Raghav.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.640 align:center line:-1
You know,

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.600 align:center line:-1
when you do such things,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.320 align:center line:-2
I feel I could only become
your aunt.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.640 align:center line:-1
I couldn't become your mom.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.080 align:center line:-1
No, aunt.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.680 align:center line:-2
Don't compare yourself
to the word mom.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.760 align:center line:-2
Without you, Unni and I
would have yearned for love.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.120 align:center line:-1
Forget about all this.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.320 align:center line:-1
Smile.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.600 align:center line:-2
Do you want to finalise Unnati's
marriage or scare them off tomorrow?

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.320 align:center line:-1
Unnati!

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.560 align:center line:-1
Unnati!

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.080 align:center line:-1
What are you doing outside?

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.040 align:center line:-2
What happened?
Can't take your eyes off me?

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.240 align:center line:-2
Unnati, what's this?
- Unnati, what's this?

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.320 align:center line:-2
Dress.
- Your knees are seen.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.440 align:center line:-1
If mother sees you like this...

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.640 align:center line:-2
Wear a 'lehenga' when you meet
the boy's family.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.880 align:center line:-2
Oh my! Obviously, I'll wear
one of these 'lehengas'

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.520 align:center line:-1
when I meet the suitor's family.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.280 align:center line:-2
I'll wear this dress for tonight's
farewell party.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.920 align:center line:-1
Forget it. Raghav won't let you go.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.400 align:center line:-2
Why? All my college friends
will be there.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.960 align:center line:-1
Can't I do things my way?

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.120 align:center line:-2
No!
- No!

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.000 align:center line:-2
If you want to put your hand
in the lion's mouth, go ahead.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.600 align:center line:-1
Go and seek permission from Raghav.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.480 align:center line:-1
I'll mollify Raghav.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.560 align:center line:-1
Are you feeling better after crying?

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.000 align:center line:-1
What? These are tears of joy, mom.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.040 align:center line:-2
Dhruv is going to Delhi.
My dream is coming true.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.480 align:center line:-1
What about my dream?

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.240 align:center line:-1
What is your dream?

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.080 align:center line:-1
You mean my marriage!

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.040 align:center line:-2
Sorry, mom. The path to my heart
is currently blocked.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.680 align:center line:-1
Raghav.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.640 align:center line:-1
Your favourite suit has a stain.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.160 align:center line:-1
What should I do with it?

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.480 align:center line:-2
No. Keep it carefully
in my cupboard

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.440 align:center line:-1
so that I can always see it

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.920 align:center line:-2
and never forget the face
of the foolish girl

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.800 align:center line:-1
who gave me this stain.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.160 align:center line:-2
The Lord has stopped creating
such faces, mom.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.160 align:center line:-2
Only a kind-hearted man
can win over my heart,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.520 align:center line:-1
not a crazy man.
