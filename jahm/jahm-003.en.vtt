00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.880 align:center line:-2
Will someone tell me
who did this to him?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.080 align:center line:-2
Yes. Look at what they did
to our boy.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.320 align:center line:-5
Hello.
- Reet.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.360 align:center line:-1
Yes, Shekhar.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.080 align:center line:-1
I received a video of...

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.440 align:center line:-1
Dhruv. I know about that video.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.600 align:center line:-5
I just wanted to inform you before
running the video on our channel.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.840 align:center line:-1
Sir!

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.600 align:center line:-1
Please give me some time.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.640 align:center line:-5
I want to know the truth
from Unnati and Dhruv.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.640 align:center line:-1
Give me a couple of hours.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.920 align:center line:-5
I will find out the truth
and call you.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.840 align:center line:-5
If what happened in the video
is true,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.120 align:center line:-5
I won't stop you
from running it on the channel.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.880 align:center line:-1
Give me a couple of hours, sir.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.600 align:center line:-5
This will impact the lives
of two people.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.560 align:center line:-4
Please.
- Okay.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.880 align:center line:-2
But I won't give you more
than a couple of hours.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200 align:center line:-1
Thank you, sir.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240 align:center line:-1
Reet, why are you silent?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.800 align:center line:-1
Call Dhruv's college and inform them

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.600 align:center line:-1
about this incident.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.200 align:center line:-1
They will reserve the seat for him.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 align:center line:-2
He didn't do anything on purpose,
right?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.920 align:center line:-1
Wait, mom.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.560 align:center line:-1
Dhruv, what happened last night?

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.400 align:center line:-1
I want to know the truth.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.280 align:center line:-1
What are you saying, Reet?

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.000 align:center line:-1
Don't you know your brother?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.560 align:center line:-1
Does he owe us an explanation?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.240 align:center line:-1
Yes, mom.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.960 align:center line:-2
It was Dhruv in the video.
I saw the video.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.800 align:center line:-1
Reet, I didn't do anything.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.000 align:center line:-1
My friends forced me to drink.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.520 align:center line:-1
But I refused them.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.000 align:center line:-1
I didn't drink. But...

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.440 align:center line:-1
But maybe they spiked my soft drink.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.720 align:center line:-2
I assure you that I cannot
misbehave with a girl,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.520 align:center line:-1
even in an unconscious state.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.760 align:center line:-1
Dhruv, is she your friend?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.120 align:center line:-2
We are only classmates.
We are not close friends.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.600 align:center line:-2
Why would I do this to anyone?
Tell me.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.400 align:center line:-2
Did you hear him?
Do you trust him now?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.000 align:center line:-1
I trust Dhruv, mom.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.880 align:center line:-1
But that's not enough.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.760 align:center line:-1
I know Dhruv's side of the story.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.040 align:center line:-2
Now, I must find out
Unnati's side of the story.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.240 align:center line:-2
I will have to talk to her
about that.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.000 align:center line:-1
But why, Reet?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.160 align:center line:-1
Why, my dear?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080 align:center line:-2
Did that girl's crazy brother
bother to find out

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.040 align:center line:-1
Dhruv's side of the story?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.720 align:center line:-1
Instead, he accused him.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.040 align:center line:-1
He punished him.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.720 align:center line:-1
I know, mom.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.840 align:center line:-1
I am also angry with her brother.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.560 align:center line:-2
But that girl
is the victim right now.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.360 align:center line:-1
And Dhruv is the accused.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.120 align:center line:-1
I know Dhruv's story.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.600 align:center line:-1
Now, I must talk to Unnati.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.920 align:center line:-2
But...
- Mom, please!

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.680 align:center line:-1
Please.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.520 align:center line:-2
Do you understand?
If they are here to meet Unnati,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.320 align:center line:-2
it means they have
either ignored the video

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.360 align:center line:-1
or know nothing about it.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.080 align:center line:-1
So, listen to me now.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.680 align:center line:-1
We only need to think

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.800 align:center line:-2
about what's best for Unnati
right now.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.680 align:center line:-1
Do you get it?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.640 align:center line:-1
So, please be calm.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.040 align:center line:-2
No, thanks.
- Please have it.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.320 align:center line:-1
Greetings, everyone.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.200 align:center line:-1
Greetings.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.520 align:center line:-2
You have already met
the rest of the family.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.040 align:center line:-2
Meet Unnati's elder brother.
Raghav Suryavanshi.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.280 align:center line:-2
Greetings.
- Bless you.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.480 align:center line:-2
Where is Unnati?
- Turn around.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.520 align:center line:-1
Here she comes.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.600 align:center line:-1
Greet everyone.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.600 align:center line:-1
Why did you bring all these gifts?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.280 align:center line:-2
Because I admire
my future daughter-in-law a lot.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.360 align:center line:-1
What are we waiting for?

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.360 align:center line:-1
Let's say yes and fix the alliance.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.280 align:center line:-1
Sir!

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.240 align:center line:-2
Sir, we have already said yes.
- Look.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.880 align:center line:-2
Let's perform the ritual with Unnati
and fix the alliance.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.880 align:center line:-1
Sure. Why not? Let's perform it.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.680 align:center line:-1
Wait.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.080 align:center line:-2
Before you fix your son's alliance
with my sister,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.800 align:center line:-1
I want to tell you something.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.960 align:center line:-1
Raghav, you want to share

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.840 align:center line:-2
your plans for Unnati's wedding,
right?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.240 align:center line:-2
You can tell them everything
after the ritual.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.440 align:center line:-1
Let's proceed, ma'am.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.920 align:center line:-1
No.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.680 align:center line:-2
Raghav...
- Aunt, please.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.360 align:center line:-2
It's important
to tell them the truth.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.200 align:center line:-2
A relationship can't be based
on a secret.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.480 align:center line:-2
Otherwise, that secret
can ruin the relationship.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.600 align:center line:-1
Unni went to a party last night.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.880 align:center line:-1
And an incident took place there.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.520 align:center line:-1
An incident?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.880 align:center line:-1
Dad!

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400 align:center line:-1
Look at this.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.960 align:center line:-1
This is Unnati.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.120 align:center line:-2
Isn't this Unnati?
- Yes.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.320 align:center line:-2
But what you just saw in the video
is not true.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.040 align:center line:-2
What we just saw in the video
is called being shameless.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.040 align:center line:-2
This girl is shameless.
And so are you.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.840 align:center line:-1
Did you think

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.480 align:center line:-2
you would manage to trick us
into fixing this alliance?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.240 align:center line:-1
Look, you are mistaken.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.120 align:center line:-1
Are you serious?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.080 align:center line:-1
This girl was wearing a short dress!

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.640 align:center line:-1
She was having fun

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.840 align:center line:-2
in a ladies' restroom with a boy...
- Don't you dare!

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.200 align:center line:-1
Not another word against my sister!

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.400 align:center line:-2
We don't want to fix
an alliance with you.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.880 align:center line:-1
Get out of my house.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.720 align:center line:-1
Yes, we are leaving.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.320 align:center line:-2
Ma'am, please give us a chance
to explain.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.360 align:center line:-1
We will explain everything

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.120 align:center line:-1
to the community.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.400 align:center line:-2
No boy from MP will marry
your sister, let alone from Gwalior.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.480 align:center line:-1
Let's go, son.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.440 align:center line:-1
Just a minute. Wait.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.760 align:center line:-1
Listen, ma'am. Please hear us out.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.760 align:center line:-1
Raghav is right.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.920 align:center line:-2
What you saw in the video
was not true.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.400 align:center line:-1
Raghav! What have you done?

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.640 align:center line:-1
Why did you tell them all this?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.960 align:center line:-2
I won't form Unni's alliance
with anyone based on a lie.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.480 align:center line:-1
A lie!

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.720 align:center line:-1
Please tell him

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.440 align:center line:-2
what happens after a girl's alliance
is called off!

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.760 align:center line:-2
Raghav...
- Sir!

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.960 align:center line:-1
A girl just barged in.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.520 align:center line:-1
Who was she?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.000 align:center line:-1
It's me.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.760 align:center line:-2
'Listen, crazy man. You can
use them to clean the filth'

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.760 align:center line:-2
'regarding money
that you have in your mind.'

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.600 align:center line:-1
I want to talk to Unnati.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.040 align:center line:-1
How dare you come here?

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.480 align:center line:-2
Look, I only want to know
Unnati's side of the story.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.840 align:center line:-1
I want to know the truth.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.480 align:center line:-1
Guards, drag her out.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.560 align:center line:-2
Ma'am, let's go.
- Unnati.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.760 align:center line:-1
Tell me the truth.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.920 align:center line:-2
You are not here to know the truth
but to blackmail us.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.440 align:center line:-1
It is rightly said.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.000 align:center line:-1
Middle-class people are cunning.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.640 align:center line:-2
They don't miss a chance
to take advantage of anyone.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.520 align:center line:-1
And rich people are delusional.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.440 align:center line:-2
They only find others wrong.
Not themselves.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.320 align:center line:-1
Raghav is right.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.320 align:center line:-1
Isn't this your job?

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.360 align:center line:-1
You frame a rich family in a scandal

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.840 align:center line:-1
to extort money from them.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.440 align:center line:-2
That's why you came here
as soon as you learned

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.440 align:center line:-1
about Unnati's alliance.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.680 align:center line:-1
Stop it!

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.560 align:center line:-1
Rich people become so arrogant

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.600 align:center line:-2
that they lose the ability
to think straight.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.160 align:center line:-2
Keep your money to yourself.
Worship it all you want.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.880 align:center line:-2
I am here to learn the truth
from Unnati.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.840 align:center line:-1
Unnati.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.040 align:center line:-2
People say that even fire
can't harm the truth.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.520 align:center line:-1
But I believe

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.400 align:center line:-2
that if a lie is presented
as the truth,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.240 align:center line:-1
it can ruin many lives.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.240 align:center line:-1
Don't be scared.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.040 align:center line:-1
Tell me.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.720 align:center line:-2
Did my brother misbehave
with you last night?

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.520 align:center line:-1
Tell me, Unnati.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.040 align:center line:-1
If he did,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.040 align:center line:-1
I would grab his collar

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.040 align:center line:-2
and take him to the police station
in front of you.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.080 align:center line:-1
I will get him punished.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.680 align:center line:-2
People will say a hundred things
after watching the video.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.800 align:center line:-2
But I want to know
the truth from you.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.560 align:center line:-1
Please, Unnati.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.240 align:center line:-1
Did Dhruv misbehave with you?

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.400 align:center line:-1
Don't be scared, Unnati. Tell me.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.880 align:center line:-1
Did he do anything wrong?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.080 align:center line:-2
You don't have to be scared.
If Dhruv misbehaved with you...

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.640 align:center line:-2
Don't you get it?
- Raghav, please!

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.680 align:center line:-1
Dhruv didn't do anything.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.280 align:center line:-1
Yes. Dhruv is innocent.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.400 align:center line:-1
Whatever happened was an accident.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.800 align:center line:-1
Thank you so much, Unnati.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.160 align:center line:-2
You have lifted a huge burden
of my heart.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.880 align:center line:-1
Thank you.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.400 align:center line:-2
Don't give your brother
a clean chit already.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.720 align:center line:-1
My sister is naive.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.600 align:center line:-2
Maybe she is saying this
under someone's pressure.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.080 align:center line:-2
It doesn't matter if he misbehaved
with her or not.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.760 align:center line:-2
The truth is that he was
in the video with Unnati.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.480 align:center line:-2
The suitor and his family
insulted us today.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.880 align:center line:-2
The whole of Gwalior
will make fun of us now.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.000 align:center line:-1
How will Unnati find a suitor now?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.200 align:center line:-1
Who will marry her?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.440 align:center line:-1
I will.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.160 align:center line:-1
I will marry Unnati.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.360 align:center line:-2
Hey!
- Leave him! He is my brother!

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.560 align:center line:-1
Dhruv, what are you doing here?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.880 align:center line:-2
You are not even equal
to my sister's shadow.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.080 align:center line:-1
And you want to marry her!

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.240 align:center line:-2
Let me finish the task
that I left unfinished

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.880 align:center line:-1
in the morning.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.240 align:center line:-1
I will kill you!

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.840 align:center line:-2
Raghav!
- Raghav!

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.120 align:center line:-2
Let go of him!
- Raghav, leave him!

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.880 align:center line:-2
Raghav!
- Let go of him!

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.240 align:center line:-1
Okay, kill me.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.480 align:center line:-2
Unnati's alliance was called off
because of me, right?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.280 align:center line:-1
So, I will marry her.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.680 align:center line:-2
Don't you dare!
- Dhruv!

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.360 align:center line:-2
Don't take my sister's name
with your filthy mouth!

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.440 align:center line:-1
Take him away from here!

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.480 align:center line:-2
Dhruv, let's go.
- I will leave.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.640 align:center line:-1
Unnati, tell me.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.640 align:center line:-1
Will you marry me?

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.200 align:center line:-2
I will kill you!
- No!

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.280 align:center line:-1
Please!

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.000 align:center line:-1
Dhruv, you shouldn't have come here.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.440 align:center line:-1
You don't know what you are saying.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.800 align:center line:-1
Listen.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.840 align:center line:-2
I apologise to you
for what happened.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.600 align:center line:-1
Let's go, Dhruv.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.240 align:center line:-1
Wait.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.120 align:center line:-1
The matter hasn't ended here.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.520 align:center line:-1
Raghav Suryavanshi.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.600 align:center line:-1
You will always remember this name.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.480 align:center line:-2
Because I don't leave
any tasks unfinished.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.080 align:center line:-1
Let's go, Dhruv.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.920 align:center line:-1
Dhruv!

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.000 align:center line:-1
What were you going to do?

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.800 align:center line:-2
That crazy man
could have killed you!

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.520 align:center line:-2
I am handling things, right?
Why did you come in front of him?

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.840 align:center line:-2
Because you were neither
at the party nor in the video.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.000 align:center line:-2
If you are not responsible
for what happened to Unnati,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.400 align:center line:-1
why will you fix things?

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.680 align:center line:-2
Because you are my brother.
- No, Reet.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.920 align:center line:-1
You still consider me a kid.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.120 align:center line:-1
You are still protective of me.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.600 align:center line:-1
You still make decisions for me.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.760 align:center line:-1
But not today.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.760 align:center line:-2
You and mom have made me
sensible enough

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.240 align:center line:-1
to decide for myself.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.600 align:center line:-1
And I am also capable of facing

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.240 align:center line:-1
the consequences of my decision.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.320 align:center line:-1
Dhruv, this is too risky.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.240 align:center line:-1
That crazy man can do anything.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.840 align:center line:-2
Let him do whatever he wants, Reet!
How does it matter?

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.480 align:center line:-2
A girl's life has been ruined
because of me.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.120 align:center line:-2
If they want to kill me for that...
- Dhruv!

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.040 align:center line:-1
I accept it.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.680 align:center line:-1
I will only listen to my heart now.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.560 align:center line:-2
Because that is what
you have taught me to do.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.960 align:center line:-2
You always listen to your heart,
right?

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.600 align:center line:-2
Yes, Reet.
- Shekhar.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.600 align:center line:-1
Dhruv is innocent.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.120 align:center line:-1
I spoke to the girl in the video.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.640 align:center line:-2
Please don't run the video
on your news channel.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.960 align:center line:-2
Otherwise, some nonsense people
will get a chance

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.040 align:center line:-1
to malign that girl's image.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.360 align:center line:-2
You are right, Reet.
We won't run the video.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.680 align:center line:-1
Thank you, sir.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.720 align:center line:-1
Raghav!

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.120 align:center line:-2
Raghav, what... Raghav!
Raghav, stop!

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.840 align:center line:-2
What are you doing, Raghav?
Stop it!

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.800 align:center line:-1
Calm down, son.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.760 align:center line:-2
There is no need to remove
this decor.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.120 align:center line:-2
We decorated the house
for Unnati's wedding, right?

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.960 align:center line:-1
Unnati will get married.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.680 align:center line:-1
What are you saying, aunt?

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.880 align:center line:-2
After what happened today,
if not years,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.640 align:center line:-1
it will take us a few months

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.680 align:center line:-1
to find a good alliance for Unni.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.480 align:center line:-2
You always wanted a truthful suitor
for Unnati.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.960 align:center line:-2
You wanted someone
who had principles.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.200 align:center line:-1
One such boy came to us today.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.400 align:center line:-1
He was truthful.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.000 align:center line:-1
He looked into your eyes

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.320 align:center line:-1
and said he would marry Unnati.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.600 align:center line:-1
What are you saying, aunt?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.320 align:center line:-2
You want me to marry off Unnati
to that disgusting boy!

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.120 align:center line:-1
He ruined her reputation!

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.040 align:center line:-1
That two-bit boy should be punished!

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.960 align:center line:-1
And you want me to reward her!

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.360 align:center line:-2
I would have tolerated it
if outsiders suggested this.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.560 align:center line:-1
But I didn't expect this from you.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.560 align:center line:-1
Are you...

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.400 align:center line:-2
Are you accusing me
of treating you like an outsider?

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.320 align:center line:-1
Really?

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.760 align:center line:-1
I have raised Unnati like a mother.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.800 align:center line:-1
Then why would you say that?

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.280 align:center line:-2
Because when you can't see light
at the end of the tunnel,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.640 align:center line:-1
you should befriend darkness.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.160 align:center line:-1
I agree. That boy made a mistake.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.320 align:center line:-1
But he wasn't a criminal.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.240 align:center line:-1
And Unnati also said

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.280 align:center line:-2
that he didn't misbehave with her,
right?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.760 align:center line:-1
I admit that he is not rich.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.360 align:center line:-2
But the way he spoke to us,
it was evident

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.880 align:center line:-1
that he belonged to a decent family.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.680 align:center line:-2
Aren't you rich enough
to fulfil other requirements?

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.920 align:center line:-1
Why don't you make that boy a prince

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.080 align:center line:-1
for your princess?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.200 align:center line:-1
No, aunt.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.640 align:center line:-2
Even if he is the last boy
on the planet,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.200 align:center line:-1
I won't get Unni married to him.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.280 align:center line:-1
But why?

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.000 align:center line:-2
You know very well
that no decent family will agree

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.160 align:center line:-2
to form an alliance with us
after what happened.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.360 align:center line:-1
Everyone has his own opinion.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.880 align:center line:-2
Today, the world is treating
the girl as a victim.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.160 align:center line:-2
Soon, they will call her
characterless.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.960 align:center line:-1
And your wealth

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.240 align:center line:-2
won't be able to prove
your sister chaste.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.360 align:center line:-1
But you want to ignore everything

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.320 align:center line:-1
and do as you please.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.320 align:center line:-1
Do you know

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.800 align:center line:-1
who you remind me of today?

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.640 align:center line:-1
It seems as if it is not you

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.640 align:center line:-2
but your mother standing
in front of me. - Aunt!

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.920 align:center line:-1
Yes.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.520 align:center line:-2
She had a distinct opinion
on everything.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.880 align:center line:-2
She didn't try to learn
about others' opinions.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.200 align:center line:-2
And you are behaving
the same way today.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.560 align:center line:-1
Raghav!

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.960 align:center line:-2
Under these circumstances,
we can't find

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.320 align:center line:-2
a better suitor than Dhruv
for Unnati.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.560 align:center line:-2
Please try to understand
my point, son.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.920 align:center line:-1
The rest is up to you.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.120 align:center line:-1
'The matter hasn't ended here.'

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.840 align:center line:-2
'Raghav Suryavanshi.
You will always remember this name.'

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.360 align:center line:-2
'Because I don't leave
any tasks unfinished.'

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.600 align:center line:-1
Did Dhruv sleep?

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.640 align:center line:-1
What happened, Reet?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.160 align:center line:-1
Are you okay?

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.440 align:center line:-1
No, mom.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.200 align:center line:-1
Nothing is okay.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.560 align:center line:-1
Dhruv has unknowingly challenged

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.000 align:center line:-1
a powerful and eccentric man's ego.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.760 align:center line:-1
No, my dear.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.840 align:center line:-1
Don't worry.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.480 align:center line:-1
Everything will be fine.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.920 align:center line:-1
How do I not worry, mom?

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.280 align:center line:-1
I saw anger in his eyes.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.040 align:center line:-1
But Dhruv couldn't see that.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.640 align:center line:-1
He said the matter hadn't ended.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.480 align:center line:-2
He won't let Dhruv
live peacefully, mom.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.160 align:center line:-1
But what can we do, Reet?

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.280 align:center line:-2

He will have to stay here.

We can't do anything.
- No, mom.

Come what may,

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.200 align:center line:-2
even if I have to move
heaven and earth,

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.520 align:center line:-2
I will get Dhruv admitted
to that college again.
