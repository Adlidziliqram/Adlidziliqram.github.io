00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.920
Wow, Rishi!

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.360
Tears and all.  You cry!

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.760
Strange!  What I mean is,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.480
you are crying here and
Lakshmi must be crying too.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.520
What happened Ayush?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.160
He left this house.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.520
He didn't even come back once.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.320
He didn't even wait for me.
- How?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.560
How about it, Rishi?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.400
How can he wait?  How many times
have I asked you to stop Lakshmi

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.080
from leaving, but you...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.440
I don't know, Rishi.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.280
I can't even see him go.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
You don't see him go.
What would you do

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.880
have you seen him go?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.440
What will you do, Rishi?

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.960
Are you going to stop it?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.680
Can you see him go?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.120
Are you going to stop it?
What would you do?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.960
Are you going to hold her
hand and lead her into this room?

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.080
What would you do?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
Ask me, man!  He looked back.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.560
And when he looks back,
his eyes search for you.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.440
He doesn't use words,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.240
but his heart, Rishi...

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.640
He keeps calling you.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.240
But you didn't come.
What more could he do?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.360
He goes.
And I'm really sorry, Rishi.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.560
He should be mad at you,
not the other way around.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200
Malishka, what did aunty do today...

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
Had it been anyone else you
know what I would have done.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.160
I bear everything because
you are my best friend.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.720
But that doesn't mean
I don't have pride.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.080
Why did I come here to
apologize?  Here's why.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.640
I really appreciate you.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
I know that what you do for me

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.200
is a big thing.  No one will.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.960
think about it.
After all, she is my mother.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.640
What will I do?
Everything happened suddenly.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.280
I do not know what to do.
That's why I can't stop it.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.920
I'm really sorry.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.800
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.400
Think about it from my
perspective and let me know

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.720
What would you do.
Are you going to stop it?  NO.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.320
Listen, Malishka.  Didn't
you hear what he said?

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.480
He wants to cut off all ties with you.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.920
Don't waste our time.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.480
Since you're here, eat
something and leave.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.760
Shut up Ashish.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.360
When did I say that I want
to cut off all ties with him?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.560
He's still my friend.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.440
But he doesn't
speak for you either.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.400
Yes, but he feels sorry.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.040
That's why he came here.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.240
And did not expect the
aunt to do such a thing.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.480
Appropriate.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.920
That's why I'm sorry.
Please, Sonal.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.560
I promise that my mother will
never treat you badly again.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.960
He will never insult you again
and I will make sure of that.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.000
I will convince him.
I will make him understand.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.440
Please come with me.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.840
What about aunt's temperament?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.480
I can't handle it, Malishka.
You have to do something.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.840
I promise you.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.640
I will handle everything.  I will
handle my mother and her emotions.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.400
Sonal, you know

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.480
that ever since you
came into my life,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.920
my dream with Rishi...

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.720
I have a feeling it will come true soon.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.840
But if you go, my
dream won't come true.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.520
That will never happen.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.040
Your dream will surely come true.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.560
I give you a promise.
Rishi will be yours.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.720
I'll make sure he's yours.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.840
But I'm sorry, Malishka.
I can't stay at your house.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.160
Sonal, please.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.240
You will not be disadvantaged.
I'll make sure.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.760
I promise you.  Just come with me.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.960
Ayush, I'm telling the truth.
I want to stop it.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.040
Actually, I'm going to stop it,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.640
but Lakshmi closes the door.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.040
That's how annoyed he was with me.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
Why did you irritate him Rishi?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.160
Why did you let things turn out like this?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.960
He closed the door!

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.000
Do you think Lakshmi
is the type to shut doors?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.160
Only a lowly person
would do such a thing.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.520
Lakshmi will never close the door.
He is a person who accepts people.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.080
And Rishi, he left the house.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.800
He left us.  He even left you.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.840
He gave us tears in return.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.880
He left us.  He left uncle, grandmother

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.160
and I.  He hurt me the most.
He gave me nothing but tears.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.720
I don't know what will happen
now Rishi.  He's not at home.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.760
What... What will we
do without him, Rishi?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.480
Sorry Ayush.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.760
I'm really sorry.  I tell
the truth.  I try to stop it.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.440
But you didnt stop him Rishi.
- I can't stop it.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.840
Rishi, ask your heart.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.040
Did you not stop it or
you don't want to stop it?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.680
I don't know what it is.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.280
The fact is I didn't
expect this from you Rishi.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.640
I didn't expect it either, Ayush.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.400
I never expected this.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.240
It's my fault, but I
really can't stop it.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.720
I am sorry.
- I am sorry.  No, Rishi!

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.160
Don't apologize.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.240
He's leaving.  He is at
the door waiting for you.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.440
I saw it in her eyes.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.920
Don't apologize for not
coming at that time, Rishi.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.080
Because I wont be able
to forgive you for this Rishi.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.800
I'm sorry, but never!

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.520
Come on!

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.440
It is my fault.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.280
Everything happened because of me.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.680
I couldn't stop Lakshmi.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.200
I won't be able to forgive myself.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.880
Because of me Lakshmi
left the house today.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.640
Had I not made that mistake
Lakshmi would not have...

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.600
He will be at home with us.
He will not leave us.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.240
I'm sorry, Lakshmi.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.760
'Your honor is mine
more than yours, Lakshmi.'

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.920
"Always remember that."

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.520
"My heart is broken."

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.240
"Everything looks boring."

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.480
"You will always support me."

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.000
'You didn't say it once,
but many times, Rishi.'

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.720
"You stand beside me."

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.960
'When everyone was
against me, you held my hand.'

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.560
"You went against mother for me."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
'But now...'

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.840
'Why are you doing this, Rishi?'

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.640
'Why did you betray me?'

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.640
'Which receipt is the original?'

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.720
'The old one'

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.160
'or this one.'

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.640
'The rishi who always
stands by my side...'

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.000
'Is he real?'

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.400
'The person who never betrayed me...'

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.160
'Or Receipt'

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720
'WHO'

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.480
'with Malishka?'

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.520
'Which receipt are you?'

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.240
'Who is the real Rishi?'

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.360
'You know, even
though I was wronged'

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.280
'and had to face so many problems,'

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.480
'I never even dreamed'

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.280
'that you'

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.520
'will betray me.'

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.320
'How could this happen?'

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.160
'How can I trust the wrong person?'

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.640
'How?'

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.360
"What are you telling me?"

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.640
Lakshmi...

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.720
Lakshmi, have your lunch.
I brought you lunch.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.760
You haven't eaten
anything since morning.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.520
Bani, I don't want to eat.
so be it.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.960
Lakshmi, will you stay
hungry all day long?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.560
No.  Come and eat.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.720
I really don't want to eat.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.120
What do you mean by that?

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.480
You will suffer if
you don't eat right.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.840
It will not reduce your pain.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.360
And things won't go back to
normal if you don't eat food.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.160
Shalu.  - What Shalu?

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.760
Did I say something wrong?

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.400
Lakshmi, since you both have
decided to divorce each other,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.000
why are you upset

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.440
Lakshmi, you have two options.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.640
You can have lunch

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.400
or change your
decision to divorce.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.760
Do what you want.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.440
But do it right now.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.000
What has happened?
Why are you looking at me?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.720
Do what you want now.  Make a
decision.  What are you doing now?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.800
Are you going to eat or go
back to my brother-in-law?

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.080
Why do you call him
your brother-in-law?

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.720
Because he is my brother-in-law.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.320
Even though you divorced her, I
still think of her as my brother-in-law.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.680
I will always consider
him as your husband.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.840
That's why he will always
be my brother-in-law.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.160
That's why don't
beat around the bush.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.280
What have you decided?  Let me know.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.800
Will you eat or return to Rishi?

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.760
Oh my God, Neelam!
I do not believe.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.000
Finally, Lakshmi left our house.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.960
The rishis are divorced.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.720
You know I only have one dream.
My only wish

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.280
has been fulfilled.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.160
Neelam, did you hear the saying

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.360
that if you want something
from the heart, God grant it?

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.120
I know this is movie dialogue,
but my wish came true.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.680
If we follow that logic,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.200
Rishi and Lakshmi don't
really love each other.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.840
They weren't meant to be.
Had that happened,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.400
they will not part.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.960
This means I was right from day one.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.760
Rishi does not love Lakshmi.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880
Correct.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.520
And Malishka loves Rishi a lot.
He fell in love with her.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.880
That is why their love is so strong.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.160
I mean Rishi became free for
the sake of Malishka, Neelam.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.600
Appropriate.  You know Karishma!

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.160
Malishka was perfect for Rishi
and she would be perfect for him.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.320
Sonia, Devika, finally!

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.320
A moment but what is this light?
What is going on?

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.560
What has happened?
Do you have any news?

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.280
What's wrong, auntie?
Have you any good news?

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.680
Aunt also looks happy.
Let me know.  What is the problem?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.400
This is long past due.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.800
What?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.960
It's all over, Sonia.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.200
Everything is done.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.240
What do you mean?  Are you
going to tell me what happened?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.520
Rishi frees himself
from Lakshmi's grip.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.480
The rishis are divorced.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.640
What?

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.560
Yes!

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.800
What?  What are you saying, auntie?
Is this really happening?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.920
Yes.  It really does.
Obviously, it happens.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.440
I am very happy, aunt.
We have to party.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.760
We're having a big party.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.320
Sonia, this needs
a big celebration.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.400
Yes.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.200
Sonia, how can
you act like this?

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.640
Is this something to celebrate?
You too, aunt.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.120
Of course Devika.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.960
Finally, my brother got rid of
that scheming middle class girl.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.960
What are you saying, Sonia?
Lakshmi is not like that.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.840
Lakshmi has endured a
lot of pain for our happiness.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.160
And we... How do we...

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.680
Lakshmi is perfect for Rishi.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.800
And Rishi

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.120
will be sad without him.
This shouldn't have happened.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.600
Are you crazy Devika?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.360
Stop siding with Lakshmi.  Okay?

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.280
His relationship with this
family has come to an end.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.040
And if Rishi was happy with her
he would not have divorced her.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.160
He will live in this house.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.640
No, Sonya.  - I do not know

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.120
when the people who are on
Lakshmi's side will open their eyes.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.200
Our eyes are open.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.120
But you've all lost your minds.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.280
You are celebrating but
have you thought about Rishi?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.320
Do you know how sad he is?

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.960
But it won't last long, Mother.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.720
Her love for him has ended.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.280
He will soon realize
that he never loved her.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.200
When there was no love
between Rishi and Lakshmi,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.920
why is he angry?

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.000
Once he realized
this, he would be fine.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.520
I can understand what makes him
happy even though I am his grandma.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.480
Even though you are his mother,
you have no idea what he wants.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.680
That's it, mother.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.320
The way I feel

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.040
that you don't understand Lakshmi,
you feel I don't understand Rishi.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.440
At this time, I want you
to understand one thing.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.520
Lakshmi came to our family recently.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.480
I meant a lot to
Rishi before that.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.520
That's why what makes
him happy and what doesn't...

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.360
I know it all too well.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.440
In that cast, it was
useless to say anything.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.840
I came here to tell you so
that Rishi will understand

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.920
because you were the one who
asked him to throw Lakshmi out.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.920
He throws Lakshmi out because
of the promise he made to you.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.840
I am sure of it.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.200
That's why Lakshmi
also gave us no excuses.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.680
Because he doesn't want
anyone to point the finger at you.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.720
That is why Lakshmi decides to
leave the house on her own accord.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.600
She doesn't want to create
problems between you and Rishi.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.320
If I start talking about Lakshmi,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.000
the day might end,

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.000
but you still won't believe me.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.960
That I want

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.480
it is for you to do something
for Rishi's happiness.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.840
Neelam, don't worry.
This is what mom does.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.560
He talks too much and overreacts.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.320
You know that he is
under Lakshmi's control.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.520
It took him some
time to get out of it.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.080
All that is fine.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.240
But mom was right about one thing.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.960
We have to do something
to make Rishi happy.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.320
And, that too, soon.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:34.560
"Dear lover, we have been together for so long."
- Lakshmi

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.960
Lakshmi, you are here!

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:46.120
"Let me tell you that you
are the only one I love."

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:07.560
"Dear lover, we have
been together for so long."

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:18.200
"Let me tell you that you
are the only one I love."

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.720
"I can only confide in you."

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.120
"You are the only
one I pray for."

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.600
Lakshmi will not return now.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.040
It's all because of me!

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.040
The way Lakshmi left the house,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.960
I forced him to do it.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.600
He will never come back now.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.120
Never.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.880
"Even if someone takes my life,"

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.120
"Please do not leave me."

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.720
"I could even die for you.
How can I not stop time?"

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.840
"Please don't go anywhere.
Don't break my heart."

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.040
"I devote myself to you.
I promise you."

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.200
"I love you so much."

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.960
"I feel our souls and not
bodies are connected."

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:36.280
"If you even look at
me once, I feel happy."

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.120
"You are the only one for me."

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.760
Lakshmi, you...
Are you here for real?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.880
"I'm the only one for you."

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.120
"You are the only one for me."

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.360
"I'm the only one for you."

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.920
"You are the only one for me."

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.120
"I'm the only one for you."

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.280
Thank you Lord!

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.800
Thank you very much God!

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360
Lakshmi!

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.880
You can't even imagine...

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560
Without you...

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.640
I feel as if

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.320
It is all over.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.080
As if my life is over without you.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.120
I mean, you left a while ago.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.800
But even in such a short
amount of time, I feel as though...

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.520
I miss you so much.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.600
I know that I have

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.800
really hurt you.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.240
I have betrayed you.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.480
I have tricked you.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.920
But whatever punishment
you want to give me,

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.600
I'm ready to accept it.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.800
But please stay.  I won't
let you go anywhere.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.320
And please don't
punish me so harshly

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.200
that I died.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.400
I can not live without you.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.400
I swear I can't live without you.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.680
I realized it in no time.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.760
I can not live without you.  I can't.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.840
Then why did you give me the reason

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.280
to leave you?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.640
You say that you
can't live without me.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.680
Then what about Malishka?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.280
Don't you know how I feel?

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.920
Don't you know that I
won't be able to tolerate it?

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.640
Don't you know that is treason?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.520
Even if Malishka
touches you I can't bear it.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.280
And I see you both

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.200
together.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.560
In the same bed.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
I was devastated right then and there.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.440
I'm dead inside.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.640
It would be better
if you killed me.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.120
No, Lakshmi!  Please don't say this.
- You should have killed me.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.240
Lakshmi.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.680
At least, I don't have
to endure this pain.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.400
I don't have to
live with this pain.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.120
You say that you
can't live without me.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.920
After what I've seen,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.040
I'm not even alive.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.080
You took my life away!
How do I live now?

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.840
How do I live?  - Lakshmi.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.040
Lakshmi, I...

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.440
I know that I have made a
big mistake.  But I don't know

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.320
how i made this mistake.
It happened by mistake.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.280
I swear I didn't know...
- You still have this nerve!

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.200
You still have the audacity to
say that it happened by mistake!

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.120
Rishi, you took a
big step by accident!

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.680
How can you do it?

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.920
I'm sorry, Lakshmi.
I'm really sorry.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.680
I have made a mistake.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.920
And mistakes cannot be justified.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.400
I know that I have hurt you.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.200
I have hurt your feelings.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.440
I know you won't be
able to forget this mistake.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.560
But I promise you

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.520
that I would never make a mistake
like that again.  I promise you.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.520
But please don't leave me.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.280
Please stay here with me.
I need you.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.480
I need you, Lakshmi.
Don't go anywhere, please.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.600
We are divorced.
- To hell with divorce, Lakshmi!

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.880
No one has the
power to separate us!

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840
I am sorry.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.760
Sorry, Lakshmi.  Excuse me.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.480
I'm really sorry.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.400
I tell the truth.
I will never hurt you.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.760
I will always be with you.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.880
I will convince my
mother and others too.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.840
And, Lakshmi...

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.640
Just tell me once

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.200
that you want to be with me.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.120
That you don't want
to leave me forever.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.280
Then I'll fix everything.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.680
Please, Lakshmi.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.840
And we're not even getting a divorce.
I will fix everything.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.560
And I must have done
something nice for you, right?

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.440
There must be
something good about me.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.520
Considering that, please
forgive me for this mistake.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.400
I must have done
something good, right?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.080
And I promise you

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.520
that I will never let
anyone do you wrong.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.720
I wouldn't make that kind of
mistake that you're aware of

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.960
you don't want to be
with me or leave me.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.800
I promise I will never
let such a thing happen.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.440
You made this promise to
me on our wedding day too.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.920
"He works like a servant,
advises like a minister,"

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.000
"looking beautiful
like Goddess Lakshmi"

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.800
"and have patience
like Mother Nature."

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.320
"He feeds like a mother and
delights in bed like Rambha."

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.240
"A woman with these virtues
is considered a good wife."

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.400
But you broke that promise.
